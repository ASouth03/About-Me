  			<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
  
  			<p>I'm an aspiring Front-End Developer with a passion for <strong>great design</strong>, <strong>adventure</strong> and <strong>the outdoors</strong>. I currently work as a Train Conductor on one of the largest Railroads in America and it's a great job but I dream of moving to Colorado and living out my dream as a developer. Through Thinkful, my dreams are starting to take shape and I'm well on my way to making my dreams a reality.</p>

  			<h1>WHERE I'M FROM</h1>
  
  			<p>I was born and raised in Fort Worth, TX where I went to college at Texas Christian University (Go FROGS!!) and graduated with a degree in Psychology. I moved around a little (Santa Barbara, Kansas City and Dallas) before coming back to Fort Worth and taking my current job but the <strong>awesome culture</strong> and <strong>cool air</strong> of the Rocky Mountains are calling my name and I hope to be in Colorado before Summer of 2015.</p>

  			<h1>MORE ABOUT ME</h1>
  
  			<h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  
  			<p>My favorite things revolve around toys with engines. I love cars, motorcycles, boats and planes. I grew up racing dirtbikes and go karts and over the years the only thing that changed was that the toys got bigger, faster and more awesome! I also <strong>LOVE</strong> hiking, mountain biking and Crossfit. OH! I recently had my first Fly Fishing experience and IT. WAS. AWESOME!!</p>
  
  			<h2>Whats your dream job?</h2>
  
  			<p>I dream of running my own development company one day, leading a team of Bad Ass Developers and creating / designing software that actually makes a difference in how people work and live.</p> 
  
  			<h2>Whats your background?</h2>
  
  			<p>I've been interested in everything web related for as long as I can remember. I have experience in SEO, Internet Marketing and Business Intelligence but my passions have always been the development and design of projects.</p>
  
  			<h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  
  			<p>I've had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFrnsANLRW4">"All Over Now"</a> by Eric Hutchinson stuck in my head for a couple of days now. Right now, as I type this, I've got the John Mayer station on Pandora in the background and Peter Hollens cover of <a href="http://youtu.be/TvJ0HzLke0Y">"I won't give up"</a> is on. I wasn't sure about it at first but I dare you to watch the video and not be impressed.</p>
